1.) The general trend in the curve is the more data that is used for training, the more accurate the model will come out.
2.) The beginning of the trend line appears to be the noisest. This is probably because the model has recieved the least amount of training data and has more room for error.
3.) Around 200 iterations will produce a relatively smooth curve.  The curve starts to become less jagged around 100 iterations
4.) The smaller the C value, the stronger the smoothing, or variability, of the function is.
